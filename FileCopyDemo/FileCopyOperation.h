/*
 This implementation is based on the RSTLCopyOperation implementation
 created by Doug Russell Copyright (c) 2013 Doug Russell. All rights reserved.
 
 I modified that implementation to be more friendly to use with OS X 10.10 operation queues,
 I highly recommend everyone to study his implementation which is more complete and can
 handle folders. I added an additional protocol and more properties to make it easy for devs
 to update guis.
