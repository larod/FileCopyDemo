{"name":"FileCopyManager","tagline":"FileCopyManager with progress indicator","body":"### Welcome To My FileCopyManager Project\r\nApple hasn't provided an API for a file copy with progress callback. The only option devs have to get this functionality is to use a lower level API, in this case copyfile(3). As always, Apple's documentation is scarce, there is no real examples on how to use this API to achieve the desired functionality. I started to work on this project with the goal of creating a couple of classes that could be easily integrated with any project and provide that familiar Finder's file copy manager. This project is not perfect and needs some work but is a start. It works well with files, I haven't tested or implemented folder handling yet. Is still a work in progress but if you want to contribute you are more than welcome to do so. The FileOperation class that wraps copyfile(3) is based on the implementation of @rustle, you can get it [here](https://github.com/rustle/RSTLCopyOperation), I highly recommend to check it out. Rustle's implementation is geared towards a terminal application but the FileCopyOperation class is more complete and can handle folders.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Pg5wEp0.png)\r\n![](http://imgur.com/Pg5wEp0)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
